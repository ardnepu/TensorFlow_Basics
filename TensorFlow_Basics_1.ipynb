So, while we have a single input matrix for the field x in the equation above, we need to run multiple iterations of w and b so as to get the optimal value of w and b for our problem. Thus, while a placeholder is enough to input the matrix once in the x field, we need a type of field in tensorflow where we can change the values at run time to eventually find out the optimal value. For this, we have a type of node called a variable in TensorFlow. a variable field's value can be changed as many times as we want at runtime. NOTE: VARIABLES NEED TO BE INITIALIZED AT THE INSTANT OF CREATION IN TENSORFLOW. However, we need to call a special line of code in TensorFlow explicity for this as shown below."
